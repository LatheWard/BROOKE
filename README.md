# BROOKE (A COBOL CRUD app) 
At the end of my time at [Base Camp Coding Academy](https://basecampcodingacademy.org/), 
I prepared a presentation along with this short CRUD (Create, Read,
Update, Delete) app to present the syntax of the [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL) programming language 
in comparison to the modern web languages we used.

This file serves as a "mini" representation to the accounts program at
Three Rivers Planning and Development District.
